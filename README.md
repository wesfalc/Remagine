Remagine! 

I developed this game during the pandemic to encourage social interaction. It helps people to get to know each other better. The basic idea of the game is to either remember or imagine (thus Re-magine) a story in your life and give a hint about the story and have others guess whether it is a true or imaginary story and whether you like it or not. 

The host starts a game with a game code. Others can join the game using that code. The host controls the flow of the game using the Admin Controls. 

Every round, one person is a topic creator and the rest of the players are story tellers. The story tellers have to think of a true or imaginary story in their life about that topic, and whether they like that story or not. They then provide a hint for that story. Then, the topic creator has to look at the provided hint and guess whether it is a true story or not and whether the story teller (the story is not told yet) likes that story or not. 

Points are awarded for correctly guessing the True vs Imaginary and Like vs Dislike part of the story. For every correct guess, the topic creator gets 1 point. 

The story tellers get points in the following way - 
For true stories - 
4 points if the topic creator guessed it correctly from the hint. 
5 points if the topic creator failed to guess it correctly from the hint. 

For imaginary stories - 
3 points if the topic creator guessed it correctly from the hint.
6 points if the topic creator failed to guess it correctly from the hint.

For like vs dislike - 
1 points if the topic creator guessed it correctly from the hint. 
3 points if the topic creator failed to guess it correctly from the hint.

After the topic creator has guessed all stories from the hints, the stories tellers then actually tell their stories. This is the most fun part. I have seen people being amazed at things they didn't know about people they thought they knew very well, because they never heard those stories being told. Also, the imaginary stories can get extremely creative, and people have laughed really hard during some of the game sessions.
